Why or when Tables have to be explicitly created in PBI?

"Calculated Tables"

1) For populating an Independent Time Dimension table having all the date & time functions in the columns.  (Typical BI Project feature)
The date and time populated table will be joined with the business table and used in reports.

2) To show some specific records of a table in a new table. (Exact same as that of View object of Database) That is ,conditional records of the imported table are shown in that newly created table.

*******3) To populate Summary Tables. Those Summary Tables will be useful further to get joined with existing imported tables as well as those Summary Tables will be useful further in creating Visuals.
