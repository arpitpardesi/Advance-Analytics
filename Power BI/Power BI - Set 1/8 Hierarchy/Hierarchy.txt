Hierarchy:

In PBI to have a drill down in a Visual we need to have a Hierarchy.

There are 2 types of Hierarchies in PBI:
1) Implicit
2) Explicit

1) Implicit -- For imported table's Date Column

2) Explicit --  Created by User or Developer:
	2.1) Can be private for a Visual

	2.2 ) Can be a column of the table. Reusable for all Visuals (Public)
