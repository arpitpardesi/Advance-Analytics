Difference Between Abstract class and interface

1) Abstract class is 0 to 100% abstract whereas
   interface is 100% abstract.
2) we use 'extends' for abstract class whereas
   we use 'implements' for interface
3) You can extend only one abstract class but
   you are allowed to implement multiple interfaces
4) Variables declared in a Java interface are
   by default final.
   An abstract class may contain non-final variables.
5) An interface cannot implement another interface
   but it can extend another interface
6) Attributes in interface are by default public
7) If we want to provide common, implemented functionality among all implementations of our component, use an abstract class. 
   Abstract classes allow us to partially implement our class, whereas interfaces contain no implementation for any members.
