When should we use Self Contained or Simple or Non Correlated Sub Queries?????
Ans. Whenever we have a derived value or indirect value in the where clause for comparison then we can use Self Contained or Simple or Non Correlated Sub Query technique.
We will get that derived value or indirect value through Sub Query.


When should we use Self Contained or Simple or Non Correlated Sub Queries?????
Ans. Whenever we have a derived value or indirect value or extracted value in the where clause for comparison then we can use Self Contained or Simple or Non Correlated Sub Query technique.
We will get that derived value or indirect value or extracted value through Sub Query.

 

select sal from emp where ename = 'SMITH' -- By this query we are deriving Smith's salary
******** OR we can also say "Whenever where clause is NOT having hard coded value for comparison"*********
