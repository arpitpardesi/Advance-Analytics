Common Table Expressions (CTE):

1) CTE is an advanced version of Derived Table (DT)
There is one major limitation of DT:
The DT itself cannot be used as a table name further in any sub query or in any other query. This problem gets solved using CTE!!!

 

How it is done?
Initially, the common resultset is declared on the top using With key word.
Then that resultset can be multiple times queried directly in the from 
clause in further main select statement or in sub query or queries 
involving set operators.

For example:
with abcd as
(select....
......
) -- Common Result Set
Select * from abcd
where col1 > (select col2
                        from abcd)
Union All
select 123
from abcd
