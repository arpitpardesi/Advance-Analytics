Indexes:
Why Index?
1) For faster access of data
2) For proper physical organization of rows inside the Data File (s) 
   (MDF & NDF)

 

Whenver table is NOT indexed then "FULL Table Scan" will happen to get 
the desired rows.

 

In any Database basically there are two distinct types of indexes:
1) Logical Index
2) Physical Index

 

1) Logical Index: The rows are NOT physically sorted in data files. But 
   the pointers to data value are kept in a separate binary structure. 
   Means data value and records numbers are kept track of separatly.
One table can have multiple Logical Indexes.
In SS Logical Index is termed as "Non-Clustered Index"
Imp point: Columns which have repeating values are best for Logical Index.

 

2) Physical Index: The rows are physically sorted in data files. 
One table can have only ONE Physical Indexes.
Imp point: Columns which have UNIQUE values (PK or UK)  are best for that.
In SS Physical Index is termed as "Clustered Index".
Whenver PK or UK is created in any database then a Physical Index gets 
created for that column.
