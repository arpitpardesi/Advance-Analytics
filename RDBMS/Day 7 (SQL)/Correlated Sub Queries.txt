Mechanism of Correlated Sub Queries:
1) The execution process starts with Parent Query.
2) The Parent Query gives the first record to child query.
3) Child query executes taking input of that record.
4) Then, Parent Query gives the next record to child query.
5) Child query executes taking input of that record
6) This process continues one by one for each record transferred 
   by parent query to child query.
7) After the last record is transferred and child query executes 
   that record then, ultimately the desired records (0 or 1 or multiple 
   records) will be shown in the output.

Correleated Sub Query with Exists Operator:

Whenever columns of the single table only needs to be displayed, but 
based on the join condition, then istead of traditional inner join we 
can use Correleated Sub Query with Exists Operator.
