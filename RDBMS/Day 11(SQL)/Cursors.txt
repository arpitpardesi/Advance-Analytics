Cursors:

 

Cursor is a mechanism in any Database which gives us ability to process (delete row or update values of the row) or fetch (select that row) ONE row at a time.

 

Cursor is a named area in memory (or buffer or cache) which will hold all the records.
The records from that area are given to the user one at a time.

 

Mechanism of Cursor:
1) Declare the cursor. Means we will mention which rows will be in the memory.
2) Declare the scalar variable (s) as per the column (s) of cursor which will hold the value (s) of each row at a time.
3) Open the cursor. Memory allocation happens.
4) Fetch first row and process it.
5) Inside Loop
    5.1) Fetch next row and process it.
    5.2) Continue 5.1 till the last row is fetched & processed.
6) Came outside Loop -- Close the cursor. Access denied to rows.
7) Deallocate the cursor.

Cursors are having scope in that session.
They are session specific and NOT batch specific.
