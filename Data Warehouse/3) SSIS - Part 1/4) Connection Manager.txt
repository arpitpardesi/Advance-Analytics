Connection Manager (CM)

CM is always associated with every Source and Target / Destination.

CM has the meta data of the Source and Target / Destination.

Meta Data means Server Name or IP Address, Database Name, User Authentication, File Name, File Path, Delimiter info, etc.

---------------------

Server Name of SQL Server: 
If you have the default Instance on the SAME machine then you can mention either of the following:
1) .
2) localhost
3) MachineName
4)IP Address

*** But in Projects it will NOT be the same machine on which SS is installed.
So, there it will be ServerMachineName\InstanceName
or ServerMachineIPAddress\InstanceName
