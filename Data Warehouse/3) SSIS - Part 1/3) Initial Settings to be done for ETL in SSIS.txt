Initial Settings to be done for ETL in SSIS:

OLE DB Source should be taken when source is RDBMS such as SQL Server, Oracle, etc.

Connection Manager: The Connection Manager has the meta data of source and target.

Connection Manager properties are different for different types of sources and targets.

Server Name: In case of SQL Server as a RDBMS the server name will be as follows:

		Server Machine Name/SQL Instance Name
		or
		Server IP Address/SQL Instance Name

If we have the default instance then only "." can also work.
When other than default instance is created then the instance name needs to be mentioned.
"SQL Express" is the instance name.
